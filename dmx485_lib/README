This library provides a simple interface for controlling DMX-512 lighting
systems using standard RS-485 and "dumb" USB-to-DMX adapters (such as the Enttec
OpenDMX USB based on the FTDI chipset).  Any RS-485 adapter that supports a baud
rate between 248756 and 255102 bps should work (an exact rate of 250000 bps is
desired, but the DMX-512 specification allows for some deviation).
